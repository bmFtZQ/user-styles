# bmFtZQ's user styles
A collection of userCSS styles, mostly made for my own personal use.

These will require an extension such as [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)
to use.

### YouTube chat in full screen mode
Places the live chat or live chat replay window next to the video when in full
screen mode, like in Twitch's theatre mode.

Please note, when in fullscreen mode and the chat is enabled, you won't be able
to use the seek bar to jump through the video due to the method of resizing the
video player.
